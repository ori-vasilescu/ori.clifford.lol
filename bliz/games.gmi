# Game Room

Sorry if you came here expecting an actual game, it's actually a room to store the games I like to play. This is partly to find common interests with people and partly to convince you to try them, they're really good!

Games in order of dearness to my heart (mostly) and recent time spent on them.

All links go to outer web pages where you can read more about and/or purchase that game.

## Video Games

Oh look I play a lot of those, so this section has subsections, someone please help me stop.
