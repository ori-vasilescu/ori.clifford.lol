# The Cinema

A dark room at what seems to be the bottom of the ship serves all flavours of popcorn and houses a large vending machine to serve soda and sweets. There seem to be some posters on the walls, advertising films and TV shows...

## Streaming

As you make your way past the flashy posters and the signs trying to draw your attention, you find a dark long hallway with several doors into film theaters that are currently showing various episodes of TV shows, probably these are the current watching list of whoever resides here and made this place. In the seats of the theatres, beans sit aligned, silently watching, will you join them?
