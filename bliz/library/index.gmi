# The Library

As you make your way through the ship, the metal hulls, the thick windows
overlooking light years of endless space, you come to a small cozy room that is
not lit by the neon you are so used to, but a soft glow. Small floating lights
dance around the room like fireflies and they draw your attention to a reading
corner fashioned with velvet cushions and a small tea table that serves
whatever beverage you most crave at any point in time. What would you like to
read?
